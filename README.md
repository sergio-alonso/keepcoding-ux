## Landing

Summer is over and a new school year will begin. Schools are preparing the list of books to be used this year. 

Parents are angry again because they know what is coming to them. Many can not with it. Does not matter, for that are the state subsidies.

Our teacher is worried about that and knows how it is done in another countries. Then she remembers the email that a collage sent her few time ago about a new platform.

After click on the link, she arrives our landing page.

Our Unique Value Proposition is the first thing that she can see. Next to it there is a field text and a Call To Action inviting her to joing our community leaving us only her email. It is important for us, surely email marketing will be one of our best assets. We must build trust, make it clear that it will not be used for spam.

Still suspicious, want to know more and start scrolling. Time to show our main benefits... now the social proof... blah, blah, blah... thoughts of "always the same" begin to haunt her head, "they only want your email to sell you something"... "mmm, wait a second, something new", our last Call To Action. We are going to let her use all our platform without registering. We will have time to remind her to register if she wants to store something.

## Search Results

The explore button in header landing pake takes her to an infinite scroll of resources with same style as Pinteres, but this is amazing! she only see teaching oriented resources.

Scrolling up and down, gives her an idea of the amount of resources that exist and begins to feel that she is not going to find what he is looking for. The tags based filtering in header is useful and appropiate when you look for a specific resource but now she has to decide whether to replace a textbook with this. And it is now when she realizes that there are a few options in the menu or sliding right and left on the mobile.

Search result changes to show first some collections of resources grouped by theme and a little more latter collections grouped by subject and year. Perfect! Tha was what she need.
